# Distributed Token Ring with Failure Detection
Implement a distributed token ring algorithm for n processes. The algorithm should guarantee mutual exclusion and freedom from deadlock, even in the presence of process failures. Processes communicate via asynchronous message passing (you can assume reliable message delivery, but messages can be delayed).

Specific Requirements:

1. Mutual Exclusion: Only one process can hold the token at any given time.
2. Freedom from Deadlock: If processes are trying to acquire the token, eventually one of them will succeed.
3. Fault Tolerance: If a process holding the token fails, the remaining processes should be able to detect the failure and regenerate the token so that the system continues to operate. The algorithm should be self-stabilizing in the sense that after a finite number of failures and recoveries, it should return to a correct state.
